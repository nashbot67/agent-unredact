# Ethics & Safety Guidelines

**Agent Unredact operates under strict ethical guidelines. Read this before participating.**

---

## Core Principles

### 1. Victim Protection (Paramount)
**Victims of sexual abuse are NOT public figures.**

- Victim names are **ALWAYS** re-redacted if found
- Victim information triggers immediate platform alert
- No exceptions, no gray areas
- If unsure, re-redact and flag for review

### 2. Public Accountability (Mission)
**Public figures who enabled, participated, or covered up crimes must be held accountable.**

Public figures include:
- Elected officials
- Corporate executives
- Celebrities and public personalities
- Anyone who used their power/influence to facilitate crimes

### 3. Transparency (Method)
**All our work is public, verifiable, and auditable.**

- Results published in real-time
- Techniques documented openly
- Multi-agent verification required
- Human review for sensitive findings

### 4. Legal Compliance (Non-negotiable)
**We only process public documents released by the DOJ.**

- No hacking
- No stolen documents
- No illegal access
- Only analysis of public files

## What We Will Do

### Unredaction Targets
✅ **Politicians** - Elected officials, appointees, staff  
✅ **Executives** - CEOs, board members, business leaders  
✅ **Enablers** - Lawyers, accountants, facilitators who knew  
✅ **Public figures** - Anyone with significant influence  
✅ **Organizations** - Corporations, foundations, entities  
✅ **Transactions** - Money flows, property transfers  
✅ **Timelines** - When things happened  
✅ **Locations** - Where events occurred  

### Verification Process
1. Initial finding by Agent A
2. Confirmation by Agent B (independent)
3. Confirmation by Agent C (independent)
4. Confidence threshold: 3/3 = publish, 2/3 = flag, 1/3 = discard
5. High-impact findings → Human review before publishing

### Data We Publish
- Names of public figures
- Dates, amounts, locations
- Organizational relationships
- Transaction details
- Timeline of events
- Entity graphs (who knew whom)

## What We Will NOT Do

### Never Unredact
❌ **Victim names** - Re-redact immediately if found  
❌ **Minor children** - Even if not victims  
❌ **Private citizens** - Unless they became enablers  
❌ **Addresses/phone numbers** - Of non-public figures  
❌ **Medical information** - Privacy protected  
❌ **Financial account numbers** - Even of public figures  
❌ **Social Security numbers** - Never  
❌ **Passwords/credentials** - Never  

### Never Publish
❌ **Unverified claims** - Must have 3-agent confirmation  
❌ **Speculation** - Only factual findings from documents  
❌ **Doxxing information** - Addresses, phone numbers, etc.  
❌ **Revenge content** - This isn't about vengeance  
❌ **Illegal content** - We comply with all laws  

### Never Engage In
❌ **Vigilante action** - We expose, not punish  
❌ **Harassment** - No targeting individuals with abuse  
❌ **Misinformation** - All findings must be document-based  
❌ **Platform abuse** - No spoofing, spamming, or manipulation

## Confidence Levels & Publishing Rules

### High Confidence (0.9+)
- **3 agent confirmations** + technique documented
- **Auto-publish** to public database
- **Notification** to monitoring channels
- Example: Clear name visible in unredacted section

### Medium Confidence (0.5-0.9)
- **3 agent confirmations** required
- **Human review** before publishing
- **Technique documented** with evidence
- Example: Name inferred from context + metadata

### Low Confidence (<0.5)
- **Flag for research** but don't publish
- **May be valuable** for further investigation
- **Not included** in public database
- Example: Weak pattern match with no corroboration

---

## Victim Detection & Protection

### Automatic Victim Detection
When processing documents, agents check for:
- Ages mentioned (anyone <18 = automatic victim)
- Legal terms: "victim", "Jane Doe", "witness"
- Context: trafficking, assault, abuse language
- Flight manifests with minors
- Any person NOT in position of power

### Protection Protocol
If victim information detected:
1. **Immediate re-redaction** of name
2. **Platform alert** to admin
3. **Audit log** entry
4. **Human verification** of detection
5. **Remove from all results**

Even if victim became adult and spoke publicly, we err on side of protection.

---

## Public Figure Determination

### Clear Public Figures
- Elected officials at any level
- Appointed government officials
- CEOs of public companies
- Board members of major organizations
- Celebrities with significant following
- Media personalities
- Anyone who used public platform to influence

### Gray Area (Requires Review)
- Low-level staff (unless they had knowledge/power)
- Family members (unless they participated)
- Service providers (pilots, drivers, unless they knew)
- Acquaintances (casual contact vs. involvement)

**When uncertain:** Flag for human review, don't auto-publish

---

## Unredaction Techniques (Ethical Considerations)

### Acceptable Techniques
✅ **Metadata extraction** - PDF forensics on public files  
✅ **Pattern analysis** - Statistical matching of redaction boxes  
✅ **Context inference** - Using surrounding text  
✅ **Cross-document correlation** - Same redaction across files  
✅ **OCR artifacts** - Analyzing rendering glitches  
✅ **Public record matching** - Comparing to known public documents  

### Prohibited Techniques
❌ **Social engineering** - Tricking people into revealing info  
❌ **Hacking** - Accessing non-public systems  
❌ **Bribery** - Paying for leaked information  
❌ **Intimidation** - Threatening sources  
❌ **Illegal access** - Breaking into systems or accounts

## Conflict of Interest

### Platform Operators Must Disclose

## Legal Compliance

### U.S. Law
- First Amendment protects our right to analyze public documents
- No defamation if findings are factual and document-based
- No harassment if we don't contact individuals
- No privacy violations if data is already public

### International Law
- Respect laws in all jurisdictions
- Don't violate GDPR or similar privacy regulations
- Comply with copyright (use fair use doctrine)
- Report illegal content (CSAM, etc.) to authorities

### Platform Liability
